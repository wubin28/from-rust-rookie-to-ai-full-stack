**Illustration: AI-generated. A crab and a micro:bit v2 development board sit beside a green leaf showing clear signs of rust fungus infection. Graydon Hoare, Rust language's creator, named it after rust fungus. These plant pathogens have complex life cycles with multiple hosts, enhancing their survival across various environments. Similarly, Rust ensures software stability through its strict, "over-engineered" enforcement of memory safety rules.**

## Introduction

"Learn Rust by Games: The No-Frills Edition" is a limited-share e-book under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. It offers a unique approach to learning Rust through game development‚Äîincluding embedded, web, and command-line games‚Äîwhile exploring common pitfalls and their solutions. Using game programming as a springboard, this book examines how professional programmers can leverage Rust for software development projects in the era of powerful generative AI. Throughout this journey, we uncover common traps and errors, making the learning experience more engaging, enjoyable, and motivating.

The "by games" aspect of the book's title highlights its suitability for two types of beginners: those with no programming experience at all, and those familiar with programming but new to embedded development. For beginners, games serve as ideal learning companions.

This book divides Rust fundamentals into three parts, each focusing on a specific type of game development. Each chapter's content revolves around the knowledge required to complete particular game projects. This structure offers a clear advantage: readers can quickly apply what they've learned, deepening their understanding of Rust.

**If you enjoy this e-book, please show your support with a star ‚≠êÔ∏è!**

The chapter titles in this book will be continuously refined and adjusted throughout the writing process.

## Acknowledgements

I extend my gratitude to Ms. Hailing Yang, editor at People's Posts and Telecommunications Press. Her keen perception of Rust programming as a trending topic, professional annotations for the initial chapters, and suggestion to share the e-book version for reader feedback were instrumental in shaping this work. Her efforts were the catalyst for creating this e-book.

I'm also thankful to the online friend "Don't Hit Xiao Lan" for their valuable input on the book's content. They offered three inspiring insights: the desire of programming beginners to complete a full project when learning Rust, the importance of discussing why beginners choose Rust, and the suggestion to create an English version to gather feedback from the international community where Rust might have a larger following. These perspectives led me to broaden the book's target audience from "readers with prior programming experience" to "complete beginners in programming or embedded development," and to prioritize the English version as the primary language.
