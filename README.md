**Illustration: AI-generated. A crab and a micro:bit v2 development board sit beside a green leaf showing clear signs of rust fungus infection. Graydon Hoare, Rust language's creator, named it after rust fungus. These plant pathogens have complex life cycles with multiple hosts, enhancing their survival across various environments. Similarly, Rust ensures software stability through its strict, "over-engineered" enforcement of memory safety rules.**

## Introduction

"Learn Rust by Games: The No-Frills Edition" is a free limited-sharing ebook released under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. The book takes a unique approach to **teaching Rust by having readers create LED games, web games, and command-line games**. Throughout the learning process, we explore common programming pitfalls and their solutions. We also show how to leverage AI tools to assist with programming, making the learning journey both practical and engaging. Our goal is to help you master Rust while having fun.

This book caters to two types of beginners: those with no programming experience at all, and developers who know other programming languages but are new to Rust. After completing Chapter 1 and lighting up their first LED, readers interested in Rust embedded development can explore other specialized books on that topic. While the first part includes embedded development, our main focus is teaching the Rust programming language itself. We chose the micro:bit v2 platform for our starting point because there's something magical about controlling twinkling LEDs and cute little buttons with Rust code.

The content is divided into three parts‚Äîembedded, web, and command-line game development. Each chapter introduces specific Rust concepts through hands-on game projects. This practical approach allows readers to immediately apply what they've learned, reinforcing their understanding of Rust.

What sets this book apart from other Rust programming guides is its focus on three key principles for beginners:

- **Learn and apply immediately**: Experience quick wins that boost confidence and motivation
- **Make benefits visible**: See the practical value of each new concept and tool
- **Ask AI good questions**: Learn effective techniques for getting helpful AI responses

**If you like this ebook, please give it a star‚≠êÔ∏è!**

The chapter titles will be refined and adjusted throughout the writing process.

## Acknowledgements

I extend my gratitude to Ms. Hailing Yang, editor at People's Posts and Telecommunications Press. Her keen perception of Rust programming as a trending topic, professional annotations for the initial chapters, and suggestion to share the e-book version for reader feedback were instrumental in shaping this work. Her efforts were the catalyst for creating this e-book.

I'm also thankful to the online friend "Don't Hit Xiao Lan" for their valuable input on the book's content. They offered three inspiring insights: the desire of programming beginners to complete a full project when learning Rust, the importance of discussing why beginners choose Rust, and the suggestion to create an English version to gather feedback from the international community where Rust might have a larger following. These perspectives led me to broaden the book's target audience from "readers with prior programming experience" to "complete beginners in programming or embedded development," and to prioritize the English version as the primary language.
